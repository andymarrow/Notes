# Notes
Notes is a simple free to use note taking app made with Node.js ,ejs and mongodb.


Notes is a platform made for everyone, irrespective of age or location. This platform features a fully customized CRUD application built with Node.js and MongoDB as its database. For the frontend, I took some assistance from Bootstrap and continued my work on EJS.

Additionally, this application incorporates an authentication system. Once a user is authenticated, they can create their own personalized notes card. They have the freedom to update it whenever necessary and delete it if desired.
